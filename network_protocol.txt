All communications start with a single line containing tab delimited fields.

The first field in the line is a function keyword to define the action to perform.  This can optionally be followed
by multiple extra arguments to parameterise the function.

If the function requires no more data then the connection will close immediately.  If extra data is required to be
sent then more data will be send and read until a special tag is received.  The tag to indicate the end of extended
transport is:

##END

..and this text should never be included in extended data sent to the server.

the server.
